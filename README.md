Demosaicing project for EC520

Each pixel in a color image has a red, green, and a blue component. A camera can capture these RGB values for each pixel using beamsplitters to separate the light into red, green, and blue components while capturing the color intensities with 3 different CCDs as in the case with 3CCD, or by using layered photodiodes that are each sensitive to only one of the red, green, or blue components as in the Foveon X3 sensor. Many high-end cameras will employ one of those technologies, but the rest of the cameras use a single CCD sensor in conjunction with a color filter array (CFA). CCD sensors are not sensitive to specific wavelengths and will therefore require a filter to obtain the intensity of the wavelength of interest. There are many different CFA patterns that can be used, the most common of which is the Bayer filter, which has twice as many green filters as blue and red, mimicking the human eye response. Since each element of the CCD will capture the intensity of only one wavelength, we need a way to determine the two missing color values for each element. This process is called demosaicing. Basic methods for demosaicing involve using an interpolation filter, while more sophisticated methods will take advantage of spatial and spectral correlations of the pixels. When a picture is taken by a digital camera, a raw image file is produced, and a demosaicing algorithm stored in the cameraâ€™s firmware will process the image.

For our project, we will implement a basic demosaicing algorithm called bilinear interpolation, as well as two more complex methods: spline interpolation and a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) based method. Then we will apply the algorithms to a set of raw images and compare the results of each method.
